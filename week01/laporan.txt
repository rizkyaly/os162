in week01 we are studying about connecting git to badak server.
Starting from cloning our GitHub and creating new file.
Now i'm already understand about push and pull to GitHub because of the pdf from week01.
In this task we are also asked to move a file inside another file from badak.
Now after I finish writing this report I will continue the task.
